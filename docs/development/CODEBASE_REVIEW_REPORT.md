## Minor Issues Found (Non-Critical)

### 🟡 Resolved Issues

1. **Line 539 in luxury_video_master_grader.py**: Blank line with whitespace (W293) - **FIXED**
2. **Line 325 in synthetic_viewer.py**: Line too long (129 > 127 characters) - **FIXED**

### 🟡 Acceptable Issues

1. **Line 102 in tests/test_material_texturing.py**: Module import not at top (E402)
   - **Status**: Intentional and documented
   - **Reason**: Import after mock setup to prevent loading heavy ML dependencies
   - **Action**: No action required - design choice

## Recommendations

### High Priority: None
All critical issues have been addressed.

### Medium Priority

1. **Documentation Consolidation** (Optional)
   - Consider moving all root-level markdown files to docs/
   - Some duplication between root and docs/ directories
   - Not critical but would improve organization

2. **Dependency Management** (Optional)
   - Consider adding dependabot for automated dependency updates
   - Already have dependabot.yml configured (✅)

### Low Priority

1. **Test Coverage Enhancement** (Optional)
   - Current 86% coverage is excellent
   - Could target 90%+ for critical paths
   - Add integration tests for full pipeline workflows

2. **Code Documentation** (Optional)
   - Add docstrings to remaining functions
   - Most critical functions already documented
   - Not urgent given code clarity
