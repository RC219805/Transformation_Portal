# Carolwood "In-Command, In-Conversation" Portrait Playbook

## Presence Compiler Context
Carolwood now treats the executive portrait as a compiled artifact rather than a best-effort capture. The v1.1 Presence Compiler spec sets precise geometry, expression, lighting, temporal, and finishing op-codes so any qualified studio can ship an image that reads as decisive yet approachable.

## Presence Compiler Blueprint (v1.1 Highlights)
- **Intent mix**: compile for Competence 0.55 and Warmth 0.45 to stabilize credibility while keeping warmth in reserve.
- **Geometry gates**: 4:5 aspect ratio with the eye-line pinned at 27% ±2%, side gutters at 14% (window 12–16%), brand band at 12% (window 10–18%), and chest band between 0.68–0.80 of frame height.
- **Expression op-codes**: mouth corners lifted 2–3°, micro lower-lid tension, chin translated 7 mm out/down, and a 3 cm lean to keep the body language engaged.
- **Lighting recipe**: key at 30–35° and just above the eye-line, fill at −1.25 stops, subtle rim separation, and background gray held between #4a4c48 and #8c8e8a.
- **Temporal cadence**: shoot 12 fps bursts around the “silent yes,” locking on the t* echo-of-decision frame 0.25–0.35 s after the peak grin where the corners settle and intent holds.
- **Finishing**: apply a gentle S-curve, +2% midtone lift, targeted clarity on eyes/cheeks, an 8% desk glare tame, and export 1065×1330 (web) plus 2400×3000 (hero) at high-quality sRGB.

## Echo-of-Decision Capture Protocol
1. Pre-light so the framing already satisfies the geometry gates.
2. Prompt: “What would you do? Give me the I’ve-got-you look,” followed by a silent yes cue.
3. Roll 0.8–1.2 s bursts at 10–12 fps; mark the peak grin (t0) audibly.
4. Select t* = t0 + 0.25-0.35 s. Optionally median-stack t*-1, t*, t*+1 with 0.7/1.0/0.7 weights for micro-stability.
5. Deliver the five-frame disruption set (t*-0.20, t*, t*+0.25, mid-gesture, relaxed reset) with metadata logging intent, angles, and parameter nudges.

## Governance Snapshot
- **Validation**: auto-score eye-line, gutters, brand band, and chest band before ship; reject if outside tolerances. Confirm localized texture preservation (>90% pore retention at 100%).
- **Field telemetry**: run A/B/C hero variants to validate CTR lift, and pairwise studies to keep C/W ≥60 with Credibility ≥65.
- **Ethics**: declare intent, avoid masking permanent features, retain disruption frames, and log subject-selected C:W intent in the manifest. Record provenance via EXIF/XMP keys (`presence.intent.C`, `presence.temporal.t_star`, etc.).

## Brand Objective
Carolwood's executive portraiture must communicate a paradoxical blend of precision and approachability. The hero frame should feel decisive yet warm, exacting yet human—someone a client would both trust with a landmark estate and call first for counsel.

## Expression Architecture
- **Eyes set the authority**: direct gaze into the lens with a gentle micro-squint (lower-lid engagement, brows neutral).
- **Mouth carries warmth**: corners lifted 2–3°, lips barely parted to read as engaged rather than posed.
- **Favor asymmetry**: subtle left–right variation (e.g., half-smile toward one eye) conveys live cognition instead of a static photo-face.
- **Prompt cadence**:
  - “Picture a client asking, ‘What would you do?’—give me the I’ve-got-you look.”
  - “Say a silent ‘yes’ as if the plan just clicked.”
  - “Breathe in through the nose, soft exhale, eyes stay with me.”

## Posture, Hands, and Body Language
- Chin out, then 5–10 mm down to define the jaw without defiance.
- Shoulders open with a 2–4 cm micro-lean toward camera to signal availability.
- Hands in "active rest": soft steeple or relaxed overlap on the desk, no tension or props unless meaningful. Rotate the watch correctly.

## Composition Framework
- **Aspect ratio**: 4:5 for the leadership grid.
- **Eye-line**: 27% ±2% from the top edge.
- **Brand band**: reserve 10–18% of the frame for the CAROLWOOD / ESTATES wordmark.
- **Side gutters**: 12–16% per side.
- **Lower crop**: include upper chest; keep hands visible but below the primary attention band (~68–80% frame height).
- **Centerline**: nose on the vertical center.
- **Environmental press variant**: shift to 2:3, lift eye-line to 36%, retain signage and desk as narrative anchors.

## Light Design
- **Key**: 5′ octa or 4×6 softbox, 30–35° off-axis, 10–15° above eye-line.
- **Fill**: –1.0 to –1.5 stops relative to key to maintain contour without harsh contrast.
- **Rim/Hair**: subtle edge light from camera-opposite, feathered to separate jacket and background by ~3–5 L* values.
- **Background**: neutral gray gradient (#4a4c48 → #8c8e8a) held ~⅓ stop darker than skin; add a light top grad to protect the wordmark.
- **Negative fill**: small black flag on the shadow side to keep the jawline crisp.

## Camera & Exposure Notes
- Focal length 85–105 mm equivalent at f/3.5–f/4.5 (sharp face, gently softened background).
- Camera height at the collarbone with a micro-tilt (<1°) downward to avoid nostril dominance.
- Shutter ≤1/160–1/200, low ISO.
- Optional: 1/8 Black Pro-Mist for subtle highlight bloom control.

## Wardrobe Calibration
- Crisp white shirt with a medium-contrast jacket; matte lapels outperform high sheen in monochrome delivery.
- Avoid tight herringbone or other patterns prone to moiré.
- Remove pocket square unless it serves a specific brand cue.

## Retouching Principles
- Preserve skin texture; remove distractions without plasticity.
- Micro dodge & burn: lift eye sockets 2–4 points, soften under-eye lines without erasing.
- Cool and lift teeth/sclera minimally—avoid paper white.
- Clean dust and lint on the jacket; reduce cuff glare; even out specular highlights along the desk.
- Apply a gentle S-curve grade with slightly lifted blacks; export sRGB.

## Frame Selection Guidance
Using the provided four monochrome frames (A–D, left to right):
- **Frame B (Hero Recommendation)**: Direct gaze, balanced micro-squint, and a "silent yes" mouth position deliver the decisive-warm equilibrium. Shoulders are open, hands relaxed, and the brand band remains unobstructed—ideal as the universal portrait.
- **Frame A**: Marginally cooler mouth expression; reserve for institutional trust collateral (board decks, investor packets) where authority should lead.
- **Frame C**: Slightly wider smile diminishes the command presence; suitable for relational touchpoints when additional warmth is needed.
- **Frame D**: The broadest smile and subtly raised shoulders trade precision for approachability; keep for informal communications only.

## Shot List to Bank
1. **Boardroom Credible** – cooler mouth tone, identical eye authority (Frame A analog).
2. **In-Conversation** – micro-smile with direct eyes (Frame B analog).
3. **Environmental Press** – 2:3 ratio with signage and desk anchors.

## Quick On-Set Checklist
- 4:5 frame, eyes at 27%, brand band 10–18%, 12–16% side gutters.
- Key light 30–35° off-axis, fill –1.25 stops, subtle rim, neutral gray background.
- Chin out/down, shoulders open, micro-lean, hands in active rest.
- Direct gaze + micro-squint, corners up 2–3°, run the “silent yes” cue.
