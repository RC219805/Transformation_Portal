## Merge Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate (Today)
```bash
# PR #103 - Critical bug fix
1. Review final changes
2. Approve and merge via GitHub UI

# PR #101 - CI improvement
1. Review final changes
2. Approve and merge via GitHub UI
```

### Phase 2: This Week
```bash
# PR #100 - VFX extension (after debugging)
1. Checkout branch: git checkout copilot/file-candidate-draft
2. Debug CI failures: pytest tests/test_realize_v8_vfx_extension.py -v
3. Fix import/dependency issues
4. Verify tests pass locally
5. Push fix and verify CI passes
6. Then merge

# PR #98 - Documentation (after unblocking)
1. Checkout branch: git checkout copilot/enhance-image-file-types
2. Run tests: pytest tests/test_format_utils.py -v
3. Request required approvals
4. Rerun CI checks if needed
5. Then merge
```

### Phase 3: Deferred (1-2 weeks)
```bash
# PR #102 - Major rework required
1. Wait for PR #98 to merge first
2. Rebase onto main (not PR #98's branch)
3. Address all 48 review comments
4. Clarify scope and purpose
5. Consider splitting into 3-4 focused PRs
6. Re-request review after rework
```

## Integration Analysis

### No Code Conflicts Found ✅

PRs #103, #101, #98, and #100 modify different areas:
- PR #103: `depth_tools.py` only
- PR #101: `.github/workflows/build.yml` only
- PR #98: Documentation and new utilities
- PR #100: New VFX modules

**Therefore:** No file-level conflicts. Can merge in any order once issues resolved.

### Dependency Issue Found ❌

PR #102 has wrong base branch:
- **Current:** `RC219805-patch-1` → `copilot/enhance-image-file-types` (PR #98)
- **Should be:** `RC219805-patch-1` → `main`

**Impact:** Creates dependency chain - PR #98 must merge before #102

## Process Improvements Recommended

Based on analysis, recommend these process changes:

### 1. Always Target `main`
- Never stack PRs on feature branches
- Prevents dependency chain issues

### 2. Keep PRs Focused
- Maximum 500-1000 lines preferred
- Single, clear objective
- Easier to review and test

### 3. Test Before Pushing
```bash
# Always run before pushing:
pytest tests/ -v
flake8 <changed-files>
pylint <changed-files>
```

### 4. Address Review Comments Promptly
- Don't let 48 comments accumulate
- Mark resolved when fixed
- Respond to all feedback

### 5. Clear PR Descriptions
Every PR should clearly state:
- What problem does this solve?
- What changes were made?
- How to test?
- Any breaking changes?

### 6. Use Draft Status Appropriately
- Draft = work in progress
- Ready for review = all tests pass, ready to merge
- Don't leave in draft indefinitely

---

## CI/CD Improvements Recommended

### Add Test Markers
```python
# pytest.ini
[pytest]
markers =
    slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')
    ml: marks tests requiring ML models
    integration: marks integration tests
```

### Split Fast/Slow Tests in CI
```yaml
# .github/workflows/build.yml
- name: Run fast tests
  run: pytest -v -m "not slow and not ml"

- name: Run slow tests (optional)
  if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  run: pytest -v -m "slow or ml"
```

### Add Caching
```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/pip
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements*.txt') }}
```
