## PR #100: Add depth-guided VFX extension ⚠️

**Branch:** `copilot/file-candidate-draft` → `main`  
**Status:** HAS CI FAILURES  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

### What It Adds
- Depth-guided VFX extension (bloom, fog, DOF, LUT masking)
- Integration with depth pipeline and material response
- Comprehensive test suite

### Issues Found

#### 1. CI Workflow Failures
**Problem:** Last 10 workflow runs all failed  
**Run IDs:** 18991636175, 18991636164, 18991546766, etc.  
**Status:** All show "failure" conclusion

**Investigation Needed:**
```bash
# Check the actual failure reason - view all logs
gh run view 18991636175 --log

# OR view logs for the first failed job
gh run view 18991636175 --log-failed

# OR list all jobs and view a specific one
gh run view 18991636175 --json jobs --jq '.jobs[] | "\(.id): \(.name) - \(.conclusion)"'
# Then view specific job: gh run view 18991636175 --job=<job-id-from-above>
```

**Likely Causes:**
1. Import errors (missing dependencies)
2. Test failures (new tests not compatible with CI environment)
3. Linting errors (flake8/pylint failures)
4. Module not found errors (new files not in package)

#### 2. New Files Not Integrated
**Files Added:**
- `realize_v8_unified_cli_extension.py`
- `realize_v8_unified.py` (modified)
- `examples/vfx_extension_example.py`
- `tests/test_realize_v8_vfx_extension.py`

**Potential Issues:**
- May need to add to `__init__.py` or setup.py
- Import paths might be incorrect
- Tests might require ML dependencies not in CI

### Action Required

**1. Investigate CI Failures**
```bash
# Clone and checkout the branch
git fetch origin copilot/file-candidate-draft
git checkout copilot/file-candidate-draft

# Run tests locally
pytest tests/test_realize_v8_vfx_extension.py -v

# Check linting
flake8 realize_v8_unified_cli_extension.py
pylint realize_v8_unified_cli_extension.py
```

**2. Fix Import/Dependency Issues**
Check if new files have correct imports:
```python
# In realize_v8_unified_cli_extension.py
# Verify these imports work:
from realize_v8_unified import enhance, _open_any, _save_with_meta
from depth_pipeline import ArchitecturalDepthPipeline

# Optional ML dependencies should be handled gracefully
try:
    from material_response import MaterialResponse
    _HAVE_MR = True
except ImportError:
    _HAVE_MR = False
```

**3. Update CI Dependencies**
If tests require scipy (for gaussian_filter), update `requirements-ci.txt`:
```
numpy>=1.20.0
scipy>=1.7.0
```

**4. Mock Heavy Dependencies in Tests**
If tests are timing out due to ML models:
```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

@pytest.fixture
def mock_depth_pipeline():
    with patch('depth_pipeline.ArchitecturalDepthPipeline') as mock:
        yield mock

def test_vfx_with_mock(mock_depth_pipeline):
    # Test without loading actual ML models
    pass
```

**5. Check Test Compatibility**
Ensure tests don't require files not in CI:
```bash
# Check for hardcoded paths
grep -r "/Users" tests/test_realize_v8_vfx_extension.py
grep -r "~/" tests/test_realize_v8_vfx_extension.py

# Replace with tempdir or fixtures
```

### Once Fixed
```bash
# Re-run CI
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger CI re-run"
git push

# Verify tests pass
pytest tests/ -v

# Then merge
```

## PR #98: Document and validate image file format support ⚠️

**Branch:** `copilot/enhance-image-file-types` → `main`  
**Status:** CI BLOCKED  
**Risk Level:** LOW (documentation only)

### What It Adds
- Comprehensive file format documentation (4 docs, ~900 lines)
- `format_utils.py` - Format validation utilities
- `examples/validate_file_formats.py` - CLI tool
- `tests/test_format_utils.py` - Test suite (90+ tests)

### Issues Found

#### 1. CI Status: Blocked
**Problem:** PR marked as "mergeable_state": "blocked"  
**Possible Causes:**
- Required approvals missing
- Required checks not passing
- Branch protection rules

**Check:**
```bash
# View PR status
gh pr view 98 --json statusCheckRollup

# Check if tests pass
gh pr checks 98
```

#### 2. Large PR Size
**Stats:** 2275 additions, 7 files  
**Concern:** Might be hard to review thoroughly

### Action Required

**1. Verify Tests Pass Locally**
```bash
git fetch origin copilot/enhance-image-file-types
git checkout copilot/enhance-image-file-types

# Run new tests
pytest tests/test_format_utils.py -v

# Test CLI tool
python examples/validate_file_formats.py --help
python examples/validate_file_formats.py tests/
```

**2. Check for Conflicts**
```bash
# Rebase onto main if needed
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main

# Resolve any conflicts
# Then force push (if needed)
git push origin copilot/enhance-image-file-types --force-with-lease
```

**3. Request Review**
- Ensure someone reviews the documentation
- Verify examples work as documented

**4. Unblock CI**
- Check branch protection settings
- Request required approvals
- Re-run failed checks if needed

### Once Unblocked
```bash
# Merge via GitHub UI
# Documentation PRs are generally safe
```

## PR #102: Reference files ❌

**Branch:** `RC219805-patch-1` → `copilot/enhance-image-file-types` (WRONG!)  
**Status:** NEEDS MAJOR REWORK  
**Risk Level:** HIGH (dependency chain issue)

### Critical Issues

#### 1. Wrong Base Branch
**Current Base:** `copilot/enhance-image-file-types` (PR #98's branch)  
**Should Be:** `main`

**Problem:** Creates dependency chain - PR #98 must merge before #102  
**Impact:** Changes will include PR #98's changes + PR #102's changes

#### 2. Large, Unfocused Scope
**Stats:** 4752 additions, 172 deletions, 12 files  
**Description:** "New files for potential enhancements and integration" (vague)

#### 3. Many Review Comments
**Comments:** 48 review comments  
**Status:** Not clear if all addressed

### Action Required

**DO NOT MERGE - Needs Complete Rework**

**Step 1: Rebase onto main**
```bash
# Checkout the branch
git fetch origin RC219805-patch-1
git checkout RC219805-patch-1

# Rebase onto main
git fetch origin main
git rebase --onto origin/main copilot/enhance-image-file-types

# This will replay only PR #102's changes on top of main
git push origin RC219805-patch-1 --force-with-lease
```

**Step 2: Update PR Base**
```bash
# Via GitHub UI:
# 1. Go to PR #102
# 2. Click "Edit" next to the title
# 3. Change base branch from `copilot/enhance-image-file-types` to `main`
```

**Step 3: Address Review Comments**
Review all 48 comments and address each one:
- Mark resolved if already fixed
- Make changes for valid feedback
- Respond to questions

**Step 4: Clarify Scope**
Update PR description to clearly state:
- What files are being added
- Why each file is needed
- What problem this solves
- How to test the changes

**Step 5: Consider Splitting**
This PR is too large. Consider breaking into focused PRs:
- PR 1: Core functionality files
- PR 2: Documentation updates
- PR 3: Test additions
- PR 4: Examples/utilities

**Step 6: Clean Up**
- Remove any temporary/debug files
- Ensure all added files have clear purpose
- Update .gitignore if needed

### Timeline
- **DO NOT MERGE** until after PR #98 merges
- **DEFER** for at least 1-2 weeks for rework
- **SPLIT** into smaller, focused PRs

   - Exception: explicit sub-PR relationships

2. **Keep PRs Focused**
   - Max 500-1000 lines per PR
   - Single, clear objective
   - Easy to review

3. **Test Before Pushing**
   - Run `pytest` locally
   - Run `flake8` and `pylint`
   - Test on clean Python environment

4. **Address Review Comments Promptly**
   - Mark resolved when fixed
   - Respond to all feedback
   - Don't let them accumulate

5. **Clear PR Descriptions**
   - What problem does this solve?
   - What changes were made?
   - How to test?
   - Any breaking changes?

6. **Use Draft Status Appropriately**
   - Draft = work in progress
   - Ready for review = all tests pass, ready to merge
   - Don't leave in draft indefinitely

---

## CI/CD Configuration

### Current Issues

1. **Long Build Times**
   - ML model downloads slow
   - Consider caching pip packages
   - Consider skipping ML tests in CI

2. **Git Diff Failures**
   - Fixed by PR #101
   - Will be resolved after merge

3. **Test Timeouts**
   - Some tests may need longer timeouts
   - Consider marking slow tests with `@pytest.mark.slow`
   - Run slow tests separately

### Recommended Changes

**1. Add Test Markers**
```python
# In pytest.ini
[pytest]
markers =
    slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')
    ml: marks tests requiring ML models
    integration: marks integration tests
```

**2. Update CI Workflow**
```yaml
# In .github/workflows/build.yml
- name: Run fast tests
  run: pytest -v -m "not slow and not ml"

- name: Run slow tests (optional)
  if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  run: pytest -v -m "slow or ml"
```

**3. Add Caching**
```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/pip
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements*.txt') }}
```
